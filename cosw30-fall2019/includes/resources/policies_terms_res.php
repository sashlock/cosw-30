California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
Petco has a vendor Code of Conduct which prohibits human rights abuses in our supply chain. Practices such as human trafficking, physical abuse of workers, unsafe work environments, failure to pay adequate wages, excessive or forced overtime, illegal child labor, and many other aspects of worker welfare are addressed by the Code. Our vendors contractually agree to follow the Code.

We require international Owned Brand manufacturers to provide evidence of a social accountability audit completed by a certified third party. This third party audit includes a review of human trafficking and slavery issues. Petco verifies the documentation for these third party audits and further requires certification from the manufacturer that they comply with all laws in their own country, including those prohibiting human trafficking and slavery. In the event a manufacturer fails to comply with any of the above requirements or fails an audit, Petco promptly reviews the failure with the manufacturer to determine if compliance can be met.

If we discover a violation of our Code of Conduct for our Owned Brand manufacturers, we respond in a manner commensurate with the nature and extent of the violation. "Critical violations" are considered serious enough to require immediate corrective action and may result in the termination of the business relationship. For less serious violations, we allow the vendor reasonable time to develop and implement a plan for remediation. However, if the vendor fails to make satisfactory progress toward improvement, we will cease our business relationship with that vendor.

Our Global Sourcing team members, who manage the Owned Brand vendor relationships, participate in annual Code of Ethics training. The training highlights the importance of safe and ethical working conditions to our business and to the workers who produce the merchandise we sell. We encourage anyone who is aware of violations of the law or our Code to notify their management, our Human Resources team, Legal Department or the Petco Hotline.</p>
