        <h1>Scott Ashlock</h1>
            <p>Hello. My name is Scott and I am a web development student. I should have my
            associate degree in web development by the end of the Fall 2019 semester. I've 
            dabbled in web design here and there since back when GeoCities was still a thing. 
            I think I made my first website in 1996 or so and edited the code using WebTV since 
            I did not have computer at the time. Beyond web development and programming I spend 
            most of my time listening to podcasts or reading. Some of my favorite podcasts are 
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.dharmapunxnyc.com" target="_blank">Dharma Punx NYC</a>: Dharma Talks and Meditations by Josh Korda</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.dolloppodcast.com" target="_blank">The Dollop</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://runesoup.com/podcast" target="_blank">Rune Soup</a>: I consider myself to be a fairly skeptical person but this gives me a weekly dose of woo ðŸ¤£</li>
            </ul>This is 
            my <a href="https://github.com/sashlock" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
